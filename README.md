# Flutter Armyknife 🔧

![Flutter Armyknife](./docs/res/armyknife_logo.png)

**Flutter Armyknife** is a collection of utility libraries for Dart and Flutter developers that provides small conveniences, just like a "Swiss Army knife."

To solve various challenges encountered in daily development work, it provides numerous lightweight and easy-to-use small libraries. Each library can be used independently, and you can select only the ones you need according to your project requirements.

## 🌟 Features

- **Lightweight Design**: Each library is specialized for minimal necessary functionality
- **Type Safety**: Safe code utilizing Dart's type system
- **Independence**: Each library can be used independently
- **Practicality**: Designed based on challenges encountered in actual development environments
